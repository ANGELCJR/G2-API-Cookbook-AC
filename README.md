Recipe's-R-Us

This project was made by:
Hieu, Le ; Castillo, Angel ; Milton, Jessica

This was a web development API project, ane our choice was to make a website where you can request a recipe using the searchBox
to find a desired recipe from the API we linked.

Spoonacular was the API used in this project, due to time restraints and challenges the use of a second API had to be ommitted.

The idea was that when searching a recipe you would get related search items and click the "view recipe" link to expand the recipe card that woudl appear
to be able to see and read the recipe.
